                    <li>Players work to build their tribes as large as possible by hiring mercenaries, scaveninging junk piles, and winning skirmishes against other players' tribes.</li>
                    <li>Each tribe member card in a tribe represents the number of people shown on the card.</li>
                    <li>The player with the largest tribe (most people) at the end of the game is the winner.</li>

                <strong>Setup</strong>

                  <ul>
                    <li>Each player takes an identical starter deck: 4 <em>Refugee</em>s, 3 <em>Scavenger</em>s, 1 <em>Brawler</em>, 1 <em>Spear</em>, 1 <em>Shovel</em>.</li>
                    <li>Return any additional <em>Refugee</em> cards to the box; they will not be used this game.</li>
                    <li>Sort the remaining cards into three categories: <em>Contested Resources</em>, <em>Junkyard</em>, and <em>Mercenaries</em>.</li>
                    <li>Each player shuffles their deck of 10 cards and places it face down in their play area.</li>
                    <li>Randomly select a player and hand them the <em>initiator card</em>; this player will serve as the initator for the first round.</li>

                <strong>Key Concepts</strong>
                <div>
                  <ol>
                    <li>A player may take multiple actions in a round.</li>
                    <li>A player may only perform a given action (<em>dig</em>/<em>hunt</em>/<em>draw</em>/<em>hire</em>/etc.) once per round.</li>
                    <li>A player may use multiple cards to increase the potency of an action.</li>
                    <li>Once a player has used a card to perform an action, they may not perform another action with that same card.</li>
                    <li>A player must combine cards like tools, <em>Group Leaders</em>, and any card with a modifier (e.g. +1, +2, +4) with another card that has the base ability.</li>
                    <li>A player may only use one tool card for any tribe member, even if that tribe member represents multiple people.</li>
                    <li>When a player needs to <em>draw</em> more cards than are available in their deck, they first draw all cards from their deck, then shuffles their disscard pile to create a new deck and continues drawing from there.</li>
                  </ol>

                    <li>Select 10 stacks of <em>mercenaries</em> and lay them out in front of you like normal.</li>

                    <li>There is no concept of an <em>Initator</em>.</li>
                    <li>Every time you shuffle your discard to form a new deck, you must take the top card of your newly shufled deck and remove it permanently from play.  This represents the attrition of your tribe over time.</li>
                    <li>There is no forced skirmish phase. On any turn, you may choose to iniate a skirmish as follows:
                      <uL>
                        <li>Select one of the available opponents (represented by the face-down stacks of cards).</li>

                        <li>During skirmish resolution, assume the opponent will take the most favorable action.</li>
                        <li>If you win, take one card of your choice from the opponent's skirmish forces as a prize and place it in your discard pile.</li>
                        <li>If you lose, you must permanently remove one card of your choice from your skirmish force and set it aside.</li>
                        <li>Whether you win or lose, the opponent's remaining skirmish force should be removed from play (thus, each of the seven forces are encountered only once).</li>

                    <li>Although there is no set timer for the game, you must constnatly balance the loss of tribe asssets as you cycle through your deck with the risk of losing by going into a skirmish half-cocked.</li>

                <strong>Leader Drafting</strong>
                <div>
                  To incorporate <em>leader</em> acquisition into the game and infuse more choice, this variant allows for drafting leaders during the game rather than at the beginning:
                  <ul>
                    <li>Shuffle all the <em>leader</em> cards together and create a new face-down pile next to the other piles.</li>
                    <li>During the game, players may use the <em>hire</em> action to persuade a <em>leader</em> to join their tribe by bribing them with food: 
                      <ul>
                        <li>Food (from <em>hunting</em>, buildings, <em>leader</em> powers, etc.) is used to bribe new <em>leaders</em>. For each food generated, the player may draw 1 card from the top of the <em>leaders</em> pile.</li>
                        <li>A player may not <em>hire</em> more than once per turn. Thus, if you <em>hire</em> a <em>leader</em>, you cannot <em>hire</em> a mercenary that same round.</li>
                        <li>The player may take one of the <em>leader</em> cards drawn in this manner and return the others to the bottom of the pile.</li>
                        <li>The <em>leader</em> card is then placed face-up in front of the player.</li>
                        <li>All <em>leader</em> powers on this card are immediately in effect.</li>
                        <li>Actions that permit peeking at a pile can target the <em>leaders</em> pile as well.</li>
                      </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>At any point during the game, a player may choose to perform this action, even if they have already taken a <em>leader</em>. When a new set of <em>leaders</em> is drawn in this manner, the player may choose to take one and replace their current <em>leader</em> (returning the rest to the bottom of the <em>leader</em> pile) or return all such cards to the bottom of the pile.</li>

                <strong>Alternate Starting Hands</strong>
                <div>
                  For variety, you may want to experiment with different starting hands. Suggested substitutions are as follows:
                  <ul>
                    <li><em>Scouting Refugees</em> for <em>Refugees</em> (depending on what leaders you have, this can be challenging as you will find a large number of card modifiers rather than base abilities).</li>
                    <li><em>Hardy Scavengers</em> for <em>Scavengers</em>.</li>
                    <li><em>Guards</em> for <em>Brawlers</em>.</li>

                  <div style="padding: 0.25em 0 0.5em;"><strong>Note:</strong> with the greater variety of mercenaries offered through the Recon expansion, it is recommended that you not include any mercenaries for hire that are part of the players' starting hands.</div>
