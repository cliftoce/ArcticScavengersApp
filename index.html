                <li>Shuffle all 28 <em>Contested Resource</em> cards together along with 2 <em>Rifles</em> and 2 <em>Thugs</em>. This should form a single pile of 32 cards.</li>
                <li>Break the 32 cards up as follows into 7 face-down piles, each representing a skirmish that you must encounter: 
                  <ul>
                    <li>One set of 3 cards.</li>
                    <li>Two sets of 4 cards.</li>

                <li>Select 10 stacks of <em>mercenaries</em> and lay them out in front of you like normal.</li>
                <li>You may play with or without a <em>Tribal Leader</em> (either way, do not select one for the opponents).</li>

            </div>
          </div>

            <strong>Gameplay</strong>
            <div>
              <ul>
                <li>There is no concept of an <em>Initator</em>.</li>
                <li>Every time you shuffle your discard to form a new deck, you must take the top card of your newly shufled deck and remove it permanently from play.  This represents the attrition of your tribe over time.</li>
                <li>There is no forced skirmish phase. On any turn, you may choose to iniate a skirmish as follows:
                  <uL>
                    <li>Select one of the available opponents (represented by the face-down stacks of cards).</li>
                    <li>Send as many or as few forces from your hand as you choose.</li>
                    <li>During skirmish resolution, assume the opponent will take the most favorable action.</li>
                    <li>If you win, take one card of your choice from the opponent's skirmish forces as a prize and place it in your discard pile.</li>
                    <li>If you lose, you must permanently remove one card of your choice from your skirmish force and set it aside.</li>
                    <li>Whether you win or lose, the opponent's remaining skirmish force should be removed from play (thus, each of the seven forces are encountered only once).</li>
                  </uL>
                </li>
                <li>Play continues until you have skirmished with each of the 7 opposing forces.</li>
                <li>Although there is no set timer for the game, you must constnatly balance the loss of tribe asssets as you cycle through your deck with the risk of losing by going into a skirmish half-cocked.</li>
                <li>After you <em>fight</em> in the seventh battle, proceed to scoring.</li>
